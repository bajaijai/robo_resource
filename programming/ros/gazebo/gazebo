1.intro

Gazebo is a 3D dynamic simulator with the ability to accurately and efficiently simulate populations of robots in complex indoor and outdoor environments. While similar to game engines, Gazebo offers physics simulation at a much higher degree of fidelity, a suite of sensors, and interfaces for both users and programs.

Typical uses of Gazebo include:

testing robotics algorithms,

designing robots,

performing regression testing with realistic scenarios

A few key features of Gazebo include:

multiple physics engines,

a rich library of robot models and environments,

a wide variety of sensors,

convenient programmatic and graphical interfaces

2.Installation Instructions for Ubuntu

Download the installer.

Copy the following text by pressing Ctrl-C:

chmod +x ~/Downloads/gazebo.sh
Press Alt-F2

A window with a prompt should appear in the upper left
Press Ctrl-V to paste the text, and press Enter

The window will disappear
Copy the following by pressing Ctrl-C:

gnome-terminal --working-directory="~" -e "./Downloads/gazebo.sh"
Press Alt-F2

A window with a prompt should appear in the upper left
Press Ctrl-V to paste the text, and press Enter

A new window will appear with a password prompt.
Enter your password, and press Enter


3.Running Gazebo
The names of the ROS nodes to launch Gazebo have changed slightly to coincide with the Gazebo executable names:

rosrun gazebo_ros gazebo launch both the Gazebo server and GUI.
rosrun gazebo_ros gzclient launch the Gazebo GUI.
rosrun gazebo_ros gzserver launch the Gazebo server.
Available nodes to run:

rosrun gazebo_ros gazebo
rosrun gazebo_ros gzserver
rosrun gazebo_ros gzclient
rosrun gazebo_ros spawn_model
rosrun gazebo_ros perf
rosrun gazebo_ros debug
