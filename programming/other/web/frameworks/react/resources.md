> ### Note:
> 1. Before you start learning React you should first get familiar with the basics of *Javascript* and *HTML*
> 2. You might find other video tutorials on youtube that explain React using `functional components` and `hooks`. This is a growing trend in the React community since the introduction of hooks in 2017.
> Although hooks are useful, I believe you must first understand the `lifecycle methods` and their implementation in `class-based components` to better understand the benefits of using hooks

## Advanced

When you get comfortable with React and have made some good projects (_Check out [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUOLi8YAwJIKq-FjGssUJQPUNhalEfPhw) to get walkthroughs of some basic web projects with React_); you could start to learn some advanced technologies like:

1. [*Gatsby*](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/): Gatsby is a `static site generator` that helps you build fast websites using React and [GraphQL](https://youtu.be/ZQL7tL2S0oQ)(_don't get overwhelmed; if you know how to read JSON, GraphQL won't be hard to learn_)

b. [Official tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/)\
c. [Documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/)

2. [*Redux*](https://redux.js.org/): When you start building big applications with React, you realise that maintaining the same state across various components of the application can be a challenging task. Even if you do manage to get everything working, it will be hard to write clean code that can be easily debugged an updated in the future. Using Redux you will be able to maintain a centeral state for all the components of the application
