# Python Web Frameworks

Although most resources suggest that you can make complete web apps using Javascript, there are many useful backend frameworks for python developers as well. The most common ones are *django* and *flask*

# Django

# Flask

Flask is a mini webframework. It is mainly used for prototyping and small projects as you can quickly develop a working MVP.

> *Note*: This should not make you question considering flask for big projects because many big companies like _Netlix_, _Lyft_ and _RedHat_ also use flask in their products
