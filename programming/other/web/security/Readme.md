# Introduction

The field of web security follows a different approach when compared to traditional web development.\
To get into the field of web security (_there are many roles like web penetration tester, bug bounty hunter, etc._) it is difficult to get a proper roadmap of things to learn. This is beacuse this field is quite vast in itself.\
Luckily, it has a growing community.

> Understanding web security should also be the goal of every developer. Read [this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-quick-introduction-to-web-security-f90beaf4dd41/) to learn about the basic terminologies

# Resources

Although, as mentioned earlier, there is no fixed set of resources that one can refer but there a few basic concepts that everyone needs to cover to get started.\
_*Following resources are actively updated and highly recommended by the security community in general*_

1. [OWASP top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)(_this is a list of the most critical security vulnerabilities_)
2. [Portswigger web academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-materials)(_has great labs and resources to help you understand commonly known vulnerabilities, ways to exploit and mitigate them_)
3. [The Web Application Hacker's Handbook](https://www.amazon.in/Web-Application-Hacker%E2%80%B2s-Handbook-Exploiting/dp/1118026470)(_This is referred to as every pentester's bible. If you try to read through all of it, you will burn out. Use it as a referrence as you learn about individual vulnerabilities_)

# Practice

Like developers participate in hackathons and build side projects to sharpen their skills, to practice your web security knowledge (_or just security in general_). Some good biggner CTF challenges are:

1. [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.org/)
2. [hacker101 ctf](https://ctf.hacker101.com/)
3. [OverTheWire Wargames](https://overthewire.org/wargames/)(_I found this one not just insightfull, but fun to play as well_)

_And there are many more happening every weekend around the world..._
You can signup at [CTFTime](https://ctftime.org/) to practise your skills at currently organised ctfs

> ## Note:
> It is completely normal to get disheartened when in the beginning you are not able to solve a single challenge. It happens to everyone. Just keep trying and when the CTF ends, read the writeups of people that were able to solve the challenges (_these can be found in the discord, slack or IRC channels of the respective CTF organisers_).

# Community

These should get you started with the basics but since this a fast growing field, you must also actively look for writeups, bug reports and conferences that are actively shared in the community.\
_I will just name a few here so that you do not get overwhelmed because there is *soo many* awsome people making great content_

1. [LiveOverflow](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClcE-kVhqyiHCcjYwcpfj9w)
2. [InsiderPHD](https://www.youtube.com/user/RapidBug)(This channel hasa a great [playlist of beginner specific videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbyncTkpno5FAC0DJYuJrEqHSMdudEffw) as well a very good [playlist to learn burp](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbyncTkpno5FwsKpcaiXBvmG2r75RLGo3) (It is an important tool that you will use quite often). Do check those out)
3. [Nahamsec](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCZDt7MuC3Hzs6IH4xODLBw)
4. [Vickie Li](https://twitter.com/vickieli7?lang=en)(_Her blogs are really good_)
5. [Hacktivity hackerone](https://hackerone.com/hacktivity?order_field=latest_disclosable_activity_at)(_This is a collection of disclosed bugs on Hackerone_)

_And many many more...._
