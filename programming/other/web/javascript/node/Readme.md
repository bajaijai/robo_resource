# Node

Node.js is an *asynchronous* *event-driven* javascript *runtime*. It was designed to give developers the power to run javascript outside the browser.

With many useful builtin apis and a huge developer community, node has now allowed developers build their complete applications using just one programming language, _javascript_.

# Resources

## Basics

Before you learn NodeJS you must have knowledge about two things:

1. Javascript
2. Backend Engineering fundamentals.

You can find resources for learning javascript in the previous directory.

To learn the fundamentals of backend engineering(_which is a broad topic in itself and hence has many different approaches to learning it_) I would recommend referring to [Hussein Nasser's Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/GISIGeometry) (_I genuinely feel that his videos are highly under-rated_). \
The best way to start and stay updated about backend engineering is by going through all the videos in the [beginner playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQUNnO4p00ua_C5mKTfldiYT) and the [Software News playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQWTOwc9bH-SRrSlbTxPMHEN)

## Beginner

To get used to the basic apis and functionality that come along with node, refer the following resources:

1. [Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLtyhwFtXQA)
2. [Documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)(_use this to get a better understanding about how to use certain api's_)

## Advanced 

Becoming a node developer requires you to get used to using modules. You can install modules using **npm**(_Node package manager_)\
The most well known modules is [Express](https://expressjs.com/) that helps you to quickly start developing a node app. Resources to learn Express are:

1. [Official tutorial with examples](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html)
2. [Video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8uL0lFFoN0)

> ### Note:
> There are many many more commonly used modules that you will learn as you make projects with node. This is a [list](https://www.freshblurbs.com/articles/important-node-js-modules.html) of somewhat popularly used node modules
