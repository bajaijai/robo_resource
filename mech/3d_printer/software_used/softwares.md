Softwares Required
==================
To build up any 3d structure, first we need its model which is made using 3d modeling software.
There are several 3d modelling softwares that are available on internet but we have to chose according to our expertise.
Some of them are named below with some details.

For Beginners:
--------------
Tinkercad - https://www.tinkercad.com 

This software is a simple, online 3D design and printing tool for the masses. Working primarily with geometric shapes and block letters and numbers, it provides an excellent introduction to 3D design for all ages. 

For Intermediate:
----------------
FreeCad - https://www.freecadweb.org/#

This software is an open source program aimed directly at mechanical engineers and product designers. It can also be used in a wider range of uses, such as architecture and other engineering specialities.

Professional quality Programs:
----------------------------
Autodesk- https://www.autodesk.com/ 

Autodesk gives free 3-year licenses to students and educators to many of its producdts, including Inventor Professional, AutoCAD, 3ds Max, Maya, and others. Choosing which program you want to use is dependent on your specific design needs

What is slicing?
================
In a nutshell, "slicing" your 3D model means taking your design (usually in .stl format) and slicing it into individual layers. The software then generates the tool path (.gcode) the printer will use for printing. Most slicing software will have a print preview function to help you prevent print failures.

The following video will help you out more regarding slicing.
